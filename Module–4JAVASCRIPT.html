    <details>
        <summary>What is JavaScript?</summary>
        <p>
            A dynamic computer programming language is called JavaScript. Its
            implementations enable client-side script to interact with users and create dynamic
            pages, and it is most frequently used as a component of web pages. It is an objectoriented programming
            language that may be interpreted. LiveScript was the
            original name of JavaScript, but Netscape changed it to JavaScript, maybe in
            response to the buzz that Java was causing. LiveScript, the predecessor to
            JavaScript, had its debut in Netscape 2.0 in 1995. Netscape, Internet Explorer, and
            other web browsers all contain the general-purpose language's core.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>A simple, interpreted programming language is JavaScript.</li>
            <li>designed for the development of network-centric applications.</li>
            <li>linked with and complementary to Java.</li>
            <li>connected with and complementary to HTML.</li>
            <li>Open and platform-neutral
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Client-Side JavaScript</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Client-side The most popular variation of the language is JavaScript. For the
            script's code to be recognized by a browser, it must be incorporated into or
            referenced from an HTML document.</p>
        <p>It implies that a web page need not be static HTML, but rather may contain
            programs that communicate with users, manage browsers, and generate HTML
            content on the go.</p>
        <p>Over typical CGI server-side scripts, the JavaScript client-side method offers a
            number of benefits. JavaScript, for instance, can be used to determine whether a
            user has supplied a valid email address in a form field.
        </p>
        <p>When a user submits a form, JavaScript is run, and only if all of the entries are
            correct are they sent to the web server.
        </p>
        <p>User-initiated events, including as button clicks, link navigation, and other explicit
            or implicit user activities, can be caught using JavaScript.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Advantages of JavaScript</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The merits of using JavaScript are âˆ’</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Less server interaction</strong> and the ability to validate user input before to
                transmitting the page to the server are two benefits of using JavaScript.
                Because of the reduced server traffic, your server will be under less stress.</li>
            <li><strong>The visitors receive immediate</strong>feedback and don't have to wait for the
                page to reload to find out whether they forgot to type something.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced interactivity</strong>You may design interfaces that respond when the
                user moves their mouse cursor over them or presses a keyboard shortcut to
                activate them.</li>
            <li><strong>Richer interfaces</strong>You can use JavaScript to integrate sliders and drag-anddrop elements
                to provide your site visitors with a Rich Interface.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Limitations of JavaScript</h2>
        <br>
        <p>JavaScript can't be used as a legitimate programming language. It lacks the
            following crucial components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-side It is not possible to read or write files using JavaScript. This is
                still here for security purposes.
            </li>
            <li>Because there is no such support, JavaScript cannot be utilized for
                networking applications.</li>
            <li>JavaScript lacks the ability to use multiple processors or threads.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <details>
        <summary> What is the use of isNaN function?</summary>
        <p>
            The isNaN() function in JavaScript can be used to determine whether a given value
            is or is not an unlawful number. If the value is a NaN, it returns true; otherwise, it
            returns false. The Number is not the same as it.isNaN() Function.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Syntax:</strong> <br> isNaN( value ) </p>
        <p><strong>Values for the single parameter</strong> that this method accepts are as follows and are mentioned
            above:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>value:</strong> It is a mandatory argument for the isNaN() method.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The result of this example</strong> isNan() function will be in boolean format and will check various
            values.</p>
        <p>
            console.log(isNaN(0 / 0)); <br>
            console.log(isNaN(12.3)); <br>
            console.log(isNaN("panchal")); <br>
            console.log(isNaN("13/12/2020")); <br>
            console.log(isNaN(-46)); <br>
            console.log(isNaN(NaN)); <br>
            console.log(isNaN(12)); <br>
        </p>

    </details>
    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <details>
        <summary>What is negative Infinity?</summary>
        <p>In Java script, a negative infinity is a number that is created by "dividing a negative number by zero."</p>
        <p>It is not necessary to create a number object in order to access this static attribute.</p>
        <p>The negative value of the infinity property of the global object is the same as the value of negative
            infinity.</p>
        <p><strong>In contrast to the mathematical infinity, the values react differently:</strong></p>
        <br>
        <ol style="padding-left: 2%;">
            <li>Any positive value multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is
                NEGATIVE_INFINITY, including POSITIVE_INFINITY.
            </li>
            <li>When a negative value is multiplied by another negative value, the result is POSITIVE_INFINITY. This
                includes NEGATIVE_INFINITY.</li>
            <li>Zero is NaN when multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY.</li>
            <li>NaN is NaN when multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY.</li>
            <li>NEGATIVE_INFINITY is POSITIVE_INFINITY when divided by any
                other negative number besides NEGATIVE_INFINITY.</li>
            <li>NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NEGATIVE_INFINITY when divided by any
                positive value other than POSITIVE_INFINITY.
            </li>
            <li>Negative_infinity is NaN when divided by either negative or positive
                infinite.</li>
            <li>Zero is the result of any division by NEGATIVE_INFINITY.</li>
        </ol>

    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <details>
        <summary>Which company developed JavaScript?</summary>
        <p><strong>Brendan Eich</strong> developed JavaScript while working at <strong> Netscape Communications</strong>
            in 1995. JavaScript was created by Netscape and Eich as a scripting language for use with Netscape
            Navigator, the company's primary web browser. In order to portray JavaScript as a companion for the Java
            language, a product of their partner Sun Microsystems, Netscape changed the language's name from LiveScript
            to JavaScript. Despite some superficial grammatical similarities,JavaScript and the Java programming
            language are unrelated.Following its release, more and more browsers began to support JavaScript. JavaScript
            was nevertheless not regarded as a serious programming language for a significant portion of its history.
            Early versions had significant speed and security problems, but there were no other options available to
            developers. They had to utilize JavaScript if they wanted to run programs in the browser.</p>

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <details>
        <summary>What are undeclared and undefined variables?</summary>
        <p>When a variable is declared but not given a value, it is said to be undefined. A keyword is not undefined.
        </p>
        <p>When we attempt to access a variable that has not yet been initialized or declared using the var or const
            keyword, we get the undeclared error. We will get a runtime error with the return value of "undefined" if we
            attempt to retrieve the value of an undeclared variable using the 'typeof' operator. The undeclared
            variables always have a global scope.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>For example: Undefined:</h2>
        <br>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            <p>
                undefined <br>
                console.log(panchal) <br>
                let panchal; <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>Undeclared:</h2>
        <br>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            <p>
                // ReferenceError: myVariable is not define <br>
                console.log(myVariable) <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Example 1:</strong> This example illustrates a situation where an undeclared variable is used.
            <br>
            function panchal() { <br>
            // 'use strict' verifies that no undeclared <br>
            // variable is present in our code <br>
            'use strict'; <br>
            x = "panchal"; <br>
            } <br>
            GFG(); // Accessing the above function <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Output</h2>
        <br>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            ReferenceError: x is not defined
        </div>

        <br>

        <p>
            <strong> Example 2:</strong> This example checks whether a given variable is undefined or not. <br>
            function checkVar() { <br>
            let string; <br>
            if (typeof variable === "undefined") { <br>
            string = "Variable is undefined"; <br>
            } else { <br>
            string = "Variable is defined"; <br>
            } <br>
            console.log(string); <br>
            } <br>
            checkVar(); <br>
            <br>
        <h2>Output</h2>
        <br>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            Variable is undefined
        </div>
        </p>
    </details>
    <!-- Question 6 -->
    <details>
        <summary>Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</summary>
        <p> <strong>HTML DOM</strong> which displays an HTML document as a tree-structure, makes
            HTML documents simple to read and alter. A Document object is created when an
            HTML file is loaded in a browser window. You can use
            the <strong> document.createElement() </strong> method to dynamically create a specific HTML
            element in JavaScript. After creation, attributes can be added. You must put the
            element into the document's DOM-tree if you want it to appear in the document.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>example</h2>
        <br>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            &lt;html&gt; <br>
            &lt;body&gt; <br>
            &lt;button onclick="create()"&gt;Create Heading&lt;/button&gt; <br>
            &lt;script&gt; <br>
            function create() { <br>
            var h1 = document.createElement('h1'); <br>
            h1.textContent = "New Heading!!!"; <br>
            h1.setAttribute('class', 'note'); <br>
            document.body.appendChild(h1); <br>
            } <br>
            &lt;/script&gt; <br>
            &lt;/body&gt; <br>
            &lt;/html&gt; <br>
        </div>

        <p>
            Please record.The element is made when <strong> document.createElement </strong> is used in
            conjunction with an HTML tag. Using <strong>setAttribute,</strong> the class attribute is changed
            after the textContent has been adjusted. A data attribute or any other kind of
            attribute, similar to how you can do so in HTML, might also be added using this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the appendChild method of the body element, the element is then finally
            attached to the body.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's actually essentially the same as &lt;h1 class="note"&gt; New Heading!!! &lt;/h1&gt;.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ability to create and style pieces "on the fly" is the strength of what we see
            today. You may either add every element to the page as you develop it or you can
            use the <strong> createElement() </strong> method to create and insert HTML elements dynamically
            at runtime.

            <strong>Example 1:</strong> In this example, we will compare the value of the same data types. <br>
            let a = 2, b=2, c=3; <br>
            let d = {name:"Ram"}; <br>
            let e = {name:"Ram"}; <br>
            let f = e; <br>
            console.log(a===b); <br>
            console.log(a===c); <br>
            console.log(d===e); <br>
            console.log(f===e); <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong> When two objects are compared, their references are examined, just like
            with other comparisons, and true is only returned if the references are identical.

        <p>
            This article will teach us how to modify an element's style or class. The UI is
            crucial if you want to create a cool website or app. With the use of JavaScript, any
            CSS property from an HTML element can be modified, added, or removed in
            response to any event. We are able to complete this work using one of two popular
            methods.

        <summary>How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</summary>
        <p>
            File reading and writing are not supported on the client side by JavaScript
            browsers. The Node.js fs module can be used for this on the server-side. It has
            techniques for reading and writing files on the file system that are both synchronous and asynchronous.
            Several examples of the node.js fs module reading
            and writing files will be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            To read and write files, utilize Javascript's fs.readFile() and rs.writeFile() APIs.
            The file is read via an internal technique called fs.readFile(). This approach reads
            the entire file into memory and stores it in a buffer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Syntax:</h2>
        <br>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            fs.readFile( file_name, encoding, callback_function )
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>Parameters:</h2>
        <br>
        <ul style="padding-left: 2%;">
            <li> <strong>filename:</strong> It includes the filename to read or, if the file was saved
                somewhere else, the entire path.</li>
            <li>The encoding of the file is kept there. The default value is 'utf8'.</li>
            <li>This is a <strong> callback function </strong> that is used after the file has been read. There are two
                inputs needed.</li>
            <li><strong>err:</strong> if there was a mistake</li>
            <li><strong>data:</strong> The contents of the file</li>
            <li><strong>Return Value:</strong> It provides both the file's contents and any faults that might
                have happened.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Data is written asynchronously to files using the fs.writeFile() function. The file
            will be replaced if it already exists.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Syntax:</h2>
        <br>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            fs.writeFile( file_name, data, options, callback )
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>Parameters:</h2>
        <br>
        <ul style="padding-left: 2%;">
            <li>&lt;file_name: &lt;strong=""&gt;The location of the file to be written is
                specified by a string, buffer, URL, or integer file description. A file
                descriptor will perform similarly to the fs. write() method when
                used.&lt;/file_name&gt;</li>
            <li>data: A string, buffer, typed array, or data view are the possible types
                of data that will be transmitted to the file.
            </li>
            <li>options: This string or object can be used to denote output options that
                are optional. There are three other criteria available for selection.</li>
            <li>The string value encoding describes the file's encoding. The default
                value is 'utf8'.</li>
            <li>mode is an integer number that indicates the file mode. The default
                value is 0o666.</li>
            <li>flag: This string represents the flag for writing files. The default value is
                "w."
            </li>
            <li>callback: When the method is executed, this function is called.</li>
            <li>Err: This is the error that will be thrown if the process fails.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Let's use the following example to explain how to write and read files: <br>
            The writeFile() method is used to create the file in the example below, and the
            readFile() method is used to read its contents.
        </p>

        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            var fs = require("fs"); <br>

            // Sample.txt is an empty file <br>
            fs.writeFile( <br>
            "sample.txt", <br>
            "Let's write a few sentences in the file", <br>
            function (err) { <br>
            if (err) { <br>
            return console.error(err); <br>
            } <br>
            // If no error the remaining code executes <br>
            console.log(" Finished writing "); <br>
            console.log("Reading the data that's written"); <br>
            // Reading the file <br>
            fs.readFile("sample.txt", function (err, data) { <br>
            if (err) { <br>
            return console.error(err); <br>

    <details>
        <summary>What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</summary>
        <p>In the last chapter, we discovered how to use conditional statements in
            JavaScript by using practical programs.</p>
        <p>
            We learn about looping and jump control statements in this chapter. Code
            blocks can be run in loops as many times as necessary.
        </p>
        <br>
        <strong>In JavaScript, the following looping statements are supported:</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>For Loop Statement</h2>
        <p>
            When a loop is used, it performs the three specified tasks (Statement 1,
            Statement 2, Statement 3) a fixed number of times. The general syntax of the
            "for" statement is demonstrated in the following code.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> Syntax </h2>
        <br>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            for (initialization; condition; increment/ decrement) <br>
            { <br>
            Executed these statements; <br>
            } <br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2> While Loop Statement </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Of all looping statements, the while one is the most straightforward. While a
            particular condition is true, a block of code is repeated in a while loop. The
            three distinct jobs have been carried out in the for loop. The same three
            specific activities are carried out in the while loop as well as where it is
            mentioned in the statement, but the initialization and conditions of the while
            loop take place in various locations. The code below demonstrates the while
            statement's basic syntax:
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <br>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            while (condition) <br>
            { <br>
            Execute these statements; //true <br>
            Increment/decrement; <br>
            } <br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>do-while Statement</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The while statement and the do-while statement are related. The condition is
            present outside the statement in the do-while construct. If the condition is not
            met, it will still run at least once. If the condition is true, the code will continue
            to run; if the condition is false, the code will cease running. The general syntax
            of the while statement is shown in the following code:
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <br>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            do <br>
            { <br>
            Execute the statements; <br>
            Increment/decrements; <br>
            } <br>
            while (condition) //true <br>
        </div>

    <!-- Question 12 -->
    <details>
        <summary>How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</summary>
        <p>
            JavaScript uses the parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator (+) functions to
            convert a string to an integer. When the string doesn't contain a number, the
            parseInt() function returns NaN (not a number). Only the specified number
            will be returned if a string containing a number is given. Spaces are not
            permitted in this function. If a specific number is supplied with spaces, the
            portion of the number that appears before the space is returned as the output.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can use the parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator (+) to turn a string
            into an integer. An illustration is used to discuss each of them.

            Where, <br>
            The string to be parsed is called string. <br>
            In the Number System, the radix is used to refer to the basis. 8 is octal, 10 is <br>
            decimal, 16 is hexadecimal, and 2 is binary. <br>
            The integer value that was extracted from the string is returned by this <br>

        <summary>What is the use of Void (0)?</summary>
        <p>
            "javascript:void(0)" may have occasionally appeared in an HTML document.
            It is frequently used when adding an expression to a web page can have
            unintended consequences. The command "javascript:void(0)" is used to
            reverse this effect. This expression yields a primitive value that is undefinable.
            This is frequently applied to hyperlinks. You may occasionally choose to
            execute some JavaScript from a link. Depending on the URL provided, the
            browser typically loads a fresh copy of the current page when you click a link.
            But if you've connected some JavaScript thereto link, you probably don't
            want this to happen. Using void(0) would stop the page from refreshing
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Example:</h2>
        <br>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            &lt;h1 style="color:green"&gt; panchal &lt;/h1&gt; <br>
            &lt;h3>without JavaScript:void(0)&lt;/h3&gt; <br>
            &lt;a href="#" ondblclick="alert('Welcome to Geeks for Geeks')"&gt; <br>
            Double click on me &lt;/a&gt; <br>
            &lt;a href="#" ondblclick="geeks()"&gt; Double click on me &lt;/a&gt; <br>
            &lt;script&gt; <br>
            function geeks(){ <br>
            document.getElementById("gfg") <br>
            .innerHTML='Welcome to GeeksforGeeks'; <br>
            } <br>
            &lt;/script&gt; <br>

        <summary> How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</summary>
        <p>
            In this post, we'll look at how JavaScript can be used to compel one page to load another.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> To forcefully load another page in Javascript, we can use the
            window.location attribute inside the script element. It is a pointer to a Location object,
            which stands in for the document's current location. By visiting a window, we can
            modify its URL.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Syntax:</h2>
        <br>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
            &lt;script&gt; <br>
            window.location = &lt; Path / URL &gt; <br>
            &lt;/script&gt; <br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the example above, we can see that modifying the window.location object inside of
            Javascript allows us to forcefully load any page from Javascript without using a href
            tag. We'll create a simple working example so we can learn it on the job.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul style="padding-left: 2%;">
            <li>
                Step 1. Make a file called index.html as the first step. Add two buttons and a heading
                to it. One button forces the loading of a live URL while the other forces the loading
                of a local HTML page. Two functions are contained in the script> tag; one loads the
                gfg homepage, and the other uses the window.location property to load a local
                HTML page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 2: Make a newPage.html file. This is the local HTML page that Javascript would
                load.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <summary>What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML
            in JavaScript?</summary>
        <p>
            Step The Document Object Model (DOM)'s innerHTML attribute is used to set or
            return an element's HTML content. where the textual content of the HTML element is
            represented by the return value. It enables JavaScript code to alter a website that is
            currently being shown. More specifically, it alters or restores an element's internal
            HTML information. Since it is the simplest approach to manipulate DOM, the
            innerHTML property is frequently used to alter the contents of webpages. But utilizing
            innerHTML in JavaScript has several drawbacks.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Using JavaScript's innerHTML property has the following drawbacks:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The process of employing innerHTML is more slower since its contents are constructed
            gradually and because previously parsed elements and contents must be re-parsed,
            which takes time.
        </p>
        <p>
            keeps any DOM element's event handlers in tact: The new elements produced by
            automatically setting innerHTML do not acquire event handlers. To do this, one must
            manually attach the event handlers to new elements and maintain track of the event
            handlers. On some browsers, this can result in a memory leak.
        </p>
        <p>
            All content has been changed: When you use innerHTML to add, append, delete, or edit
            material on a webpage, all of the content and any DOM nodes inside that element are
            replaced and recreated.
        </p>
        <p>
            InnerHTML appending is not supported: In JavaScript, adding is often done with the
            += operator. However, when using innerHTML to append to an HTML tag, the entire
            tag is re-parsed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Problem: The old content gets overwritten even while the item is present.object
            innerHTML is used.Instead of using object.innerHTML += 'html', use innerHTML +
            'html'. Appending is impossible without repartitioning the entire innerHTML. As a
            result, using innerHTML becomes extremely sluggish. When dynamic DOM elements
            must be formed, string concatenation simply cannot scale since it becomes challenging
            to keep track of the plus signs and quotation marks' openings and closings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Can cause the document to be broken: Since innerHTML does not offer appropriate
            validation, any legitimate HTML code can be used. The JavaScript document might be
            broken as a result. Even flawed HTML can be utilized, which could result in unpleasant
            surprises.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ability of innerHTML to add text and components to the webpage makes it possible
            for malevolent users to change and display unwanted or destructive content within
            other HTML element tags. This is known as cross-site scripting (XSS). Additionally,
            critical information may be lost, leaked, or changed as a result of cross-site scripting.
